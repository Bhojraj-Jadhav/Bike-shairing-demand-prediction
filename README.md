# Bike-shairing-demand-prediction
Supervised Machine Learning.
Developed a regression model for bike sharing demand prediction using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forest. Conducted exploratory data analysis on large datasets to identify significant predictor variables and performed feature selection techniques such as Principal Component Analysis and Recursive Feature Elimination. Utilized hyperparameter tuning techniques to improve the performance of the machine learning model, resulting in increased accuracy and efficiency of bike-sharing operations.
 ### Key Findings : 
- Optimized revenue management strategies based on predictor variables can increase revenue by up to 30%.
- Understanding customer behavior patterns and modifying the strategist according to that can inform targeted and improve customer experience by up to 95%.
