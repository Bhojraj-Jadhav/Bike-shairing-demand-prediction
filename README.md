# Bike-shairing-demand-prediction
Supervised Machine Learning.

* Analyze the data related to bike sharing to identify patterns and trends in demand. 
* This can help stakeholders to make informed decisions about where to deploy bikes, how many bikes to deploy, and in how much price bike sharing services.
* Using statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization tools to uncover insights and make predictions about future  emand. Which will affect bike-sharing operations by up to 80%.
